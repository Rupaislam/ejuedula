<p>In November last year, American technology firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence technology-based product funded by Microsoft. However, within a year, OpenAI&#8217;s board of directors removed Sam Altman, the inventor of ChatGPT and the company&#8217;s chief executive officer (CEO), who caused a stir in the technology world. After losing his post, Sam Altman went to the headquarters of OpenAI on Sunday. After the publication of this news, there are rumors in the technology world that Sam Altman is getting back the post of CEO of OpenAI. However, according to a report of &#8216;The Information&#8217;, Sam Altman will not get the position of CEO of OpenAI again.</p>



<p>According to reports, Ilya Sutskever, a member of OpenAI&#8217;s board of directors, sent a message to the company&#8217;s employees after Sam Altman was ousted as CEO. According to the message, Sam Altman will not return as CEO of OpenAI despite discussions. He will be replaced by Twitch co-founder Emmett Scheer as interim CEO. However, OpenAI has not officially announced any information about this.</p>



<p>Last Friday, Sam Altman was suddenly removed from the position of CEO of OpenAI. In a blog post, OpenAI said that Sam Altman has lost the ability to lead OpenAI. And for this reason he has been removed from the post of CEO.</p>



<p>Note that three senior researchers, including Greg Brockman, the president and co-founder of OpenAI, have resigned following the removal of Sam Altman.<br>Source: Reuters</p>
