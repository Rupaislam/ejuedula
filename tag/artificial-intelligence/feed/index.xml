<p>In November last year, American technology firm OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence technology-based product funded by Microsoft. However, within a year, OpenAI&#8217;s board of directors removed Sam Altman, the inventor of ChatGPT and the company&#8217;s chief executive officer (CEO), who caused a stir in the technology world. After losing his post, Sam Altman went to the headquarters of OpenAI on Sunday. After the publication of this news, there are rumors in the technology world that Sam Altman is getting back the post of CEO of OpenAI. However, according to a report of &#8216;The Information&#8217;, Sam Altman will not get the position of CEO of OpenAI again.</p>



<p>According to reports, Ilya Sutskever, a member of OpenAI&#8217;s board of directors, sent a message to the company&#8217;s employees after Sam Altman was ousted as CEO. According to the message, Sam Altman will not return as CEO of OpenAI despite discussions. He will be replaced by Twitch co-founder Emmett Scheer as interim CEO. However, OpenAI has not officially announced any information about this.</p>



<p>Last Friday, Sam Altman was suddenly removed from the position of CEO of OpenAI. In a blog post, OpenAI said that Sam Altman has lost the ability to lead OpenAI. And for this reason he has been removed from the post of CEO.</p>



<p>Note that three senior researchers, including Greg Brockman, the president and co-founder of OpenAI, have resigned following the removal of Sam Altman.<br>Source: Reuters</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has appeared with the potential to change human life unimaginably. Along with the positives, it also has its negative aspects. However, a recent study has indicated that some unprecedented changes are coming in the use of AI in the medical field.</p>



<p>The study was conducted at Oxford University in the UK. Research has shown that it is possible to predict whether a person will suffer from heart disease in the future or not, using artificial intelligence. Researchers say that it is possible to get a forecast 10 years in advance, not days-months.</p>



<p>Professor Karalambos Antoniades of Oxford University led the study. This study was conducted on 40,000 people in 8 hospitals in the UK. The researchers closely observed their physical condition for about three years and analyzed the related data.</p>



<p>Through this, researchers have found that those whose blood vessels in the heart are narrowing are at greater risk of serious heart disease and death. Compared to this, twice as many people whose blood vessels in the heart are not narrowed are also at risk of dying from a heart attack or heart disease.</p>



<p>The research team used a new AI tool. Through this, how much fat has accumulated around the blood vessels of a person&#8217;s heart or how quickly the condition is changing, the information is available. At the same time, it is possible to review the risk related to the degree of narrowing of the arteries.</p>



<p>The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), says there are millions of people who suffer from chest pain. It is not known whether they are at risk of heart attack or not. You can&#8217;t take treatment or steps to reduce the risk for this. It is possible to know the risk of heart attack in these people using artificial intelligence. It will save thousands of lives from heart disease.</p>
